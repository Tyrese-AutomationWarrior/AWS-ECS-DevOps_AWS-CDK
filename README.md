# AWS ECS DevOps using AWS CDK

This repository provides a general DevOps practices such MSA, IaC, CICD and Monitoring. AWS various services are used to provide DevOps best practices. All necessary cloud resources are modeled and deployed through AWS CDK.

## Solution Architecture

- ***Container-based MSA***: each micro-services are implemented using AWS ECS(Cluster/Service/Task)
- ***Programming-based IaC***: all cloud resources are modeld and provisioned using AWS CDK(Typescript)
- ***Fully managed CICD***: Continuous integration and continuous deploy using AWS Code Series(Pipeline/Commit/Build/Deploy)
- ***Fully managed Monitoring***: logging, metric, dashboard using Amazon CloudWatch

## CDK-Project Build & Deploy

To efficiently define and provision aws cloud resources, [AWS Cloud Development Kit(CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk) which is an open source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages is utilized.

![AWSCDKIntro](docs/asset/aws_cdk_intro.png)

Because this solusion is implemented in CDK, we can deploy these cloud resources using CDK CLI. Among the various languages supported, this solution used typescript. Because the types of **typescript** are very strict, with the help of auto-completion, typescrip offers a very nice combination with AWS CDK.

***Caution***: This solution contains not-free tier AWS services. So be careful about the possible costs.

### **Prerequisites**

First of all, AWS Account and IAM User is required. And then the following modules must be installed.

- AWS CLI: aws configure --profile [profile name]
- Node.js: node --version
- AWS CDK: cdk --version
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): jq --version

Please refer to the kind guide in [CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/15-prerequisites.html).

### ***Configure AWS Credential***

```bash
aws configure --profile [your-profile] 
AWS Access Key ID [None]: xxxxxx
AWS Secret Access Key [None]:yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Default region name [None]: us-east-2 
Default output format [None]: json
    
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile [your-profile]
...
...
{
    "UserId": ".............",
    "Account": "75157*******",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::75157*******:user/[your IAM User ID]"
}
```

### ***Check cdk project's default launch config***

The `cdk.json` file tells CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

### ***Set up deploy config***

The `config/app-config-demo.json` files tell how to configure deploy condition & stack condition. First of all, change project configurations(Account, Profile are essential) in ```config/app-config-demo.json```.

```json
{
    "Project": {
        "Name": "EcsProject",
        "Stage": "Demo",
        "Account": "75157*******",
        "Region": "us-east-2",
        "Profile": "cdk-demo"
    },
    ...
    ...
}
```

And then set the path of the configuration file through an environment variable.

```bash
export APP_CONFIG=config/app-config-demo.json
```

### ***Install dependecies & Bootstrap***

```bash
sh ./script/setup_initial.sh config/app-config-demo.json
```

### ***Deploy stacks***

Before deployment, check whether all configurations are ready. Please execute the following command.

```bash
cdk list
...
...
==> CDK App-Config File is config/app-config-demo.json, which is from Environment-Variable.
EcsProjectDemo-EcsAlbStack
EcsProjectDemo-VpcInfraStack
...
...
```

Check if you can see the list of stacks as shown above.

If there is no problem, finally run the following command.

```bash
sh ./script/deploy_stacks.sh config/app-config-demo.json
```

You can find the deployment results in AWS CloudFormation as shown in the following picture.
![cloudformation-stacks](docs/asset/cloudformation-stacks.png)

Open a web-browser and enter LoadBalancer's domain name(which is the output of ```sh script/deploy_stacks```) to see the following screen.

```bash
...
...
Outputs:
EcsProjectDemo-EcsAlbStack.EcsAlbInfraConstrunctServiceLoadBalancerDNSF445CBCD = EcsPr-EcsAl-1TNJ82PAWJ4IV-1937786873.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
EcsProjectDemo-EcsAlbStack.EcsAlbInfraConstrunctServiceServiceURL290953F6 = http://EcsPr-EcsAl-1TNJ82PAWJ4IV-1937786873.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
...
...
```

The initial screen is a php sample screen(in public DockerHub) as we haven't uploaded the source code yet.

## How to update logic

AWS CDK made CodeCommit(git) repository for you. Please visit CodeCommit in AWS management web console, note remote address of that.
![codecommit-repo](docs/asset/codecommit-repo.png)

Finally add git remote address in your development environment. Thease codes are sample for you.

```bash
git remote -v
git remote add [your-new-remote-origin-name] [your-codecommit-address]
```

After modifying logic codes(in this repository, logic codes are in ```codes/sample-flask-web```), push only that to AWS CodeCommit. Please commit this directory only, because each micro-servie has its own repository. This will trigger AWS CodePipeline and automatically re-deploy the new container image to AWS ECS Service/Task. You have to click ```Review``` button in Approve stage.

![code-pipeline](docs/asset/code-pipeline.png)

![code-pipeline](docs/asset/ecs-deployment.png)

***Caution***:  If you have modified this path( ```codes/sample-flask-web```), please reflect the changed path in ```config/app-config-demo.son``` file.

```json
...
...
    "EcsAlb": {
        "Name": "EcsAlbStack",

        "InfraVersion": "'1.0.0'",

        "PortNumber": 80,
        "AppPath": "codes/sample-flask-web", <------ Here

        "RepoName": "sample-flask-web",

        "DashboardName": "SampleFlaskWeb"
    },
...
...
```

After provisioning, you can check the updated web page like the following screen.
![new-web-page](docs/asset/new-web-page.png)

Also you can check a realtime dashboard of cloud resources in Amazon CloudWatch Dashboard.

![dashboard-one](docs/asset/dashboard-one.png)

## How to add a new service

Just add a new stack configuration in ```config/app-config-demo.json```.

And then instantiate ```Class``` like the following codes. 

Since AWS CDK(Typescript, Java, Python, ...) supports object-oriented programming language, you can create a new resource simply by instantiating the object without copying the code. This is one of the great advantages of AWS CDK.

## CDK Useful commands

* `npm install`     install dependencies
* `cdk list`        list up stacks
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## How to clean up

Execute the following command, which will destroy all resources except ECR-Repository and DynamoDB Tables. So destroy these resources in AWS web console manually.

```bash
sh ./script/destroy_stacks.sh config/app-config-demo.json
```
